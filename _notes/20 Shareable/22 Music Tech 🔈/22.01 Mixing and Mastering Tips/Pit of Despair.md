# Pit of Despair
`= "<progress value='" + (length(filter(this.file.tasks.completed, (t) => t = true)) / length(this.file.tasks)) * 100 + "' max='100'> </progress>" + " " + round((length(filter(this.file.tasks.completed, (t) => t = true)) / length(this.file.tasks)) * 100) + "%"`

In general, we’re wanting “more” but wanting to avoid just turning up the volume up on everything; Needs more differentiation and contrast, maybe play with automation and panning to create shifting focus throughout the piece

## Mix checklist

## Notes on mix 2
- [x] Is there a way to shorten or cut the transition from v1 to v2? Feels a bit long, makes it drag considering we have a longer more filled instrumental section ✅ 2022-06-27
	- Again, reluctant to make big production changes
	- I did some rides and added FX to the tines to make it more exciting
- [x] (Beginning of the second verse still feels a bit flat, gets better at 1:17) ✅ 2022-06-27
- [x] A smidge too much oom-hah? Take down maybe a decibel or two ✅ 2022-06-27

These revisions took a little less than an hour. 

### In this version
- I did some volume rides and added FX to the tines to make the transition from v1 to v2 more exciting.
- Did some automation and mutes at beginning of second verse to make it a bit more dynamic.
- Dropped the level of the oom-hahs a bit.
