# Placing acoustic panels
Spread panels out less than twice panel width for the most absorption.

Place panels at the height the sound is happening and the height of listening.

Treat first reflection points first. Thicker panels are most helpful. Find early reflection points with [this mirror trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nui7mxgeOg4).

Treat corners with bass traps.

Use this technique with low-passed pink noise to find bass buildup and place bass traps.[^1]

Treat back wall with diffusion.[^2]

Try alternating panels across parallel walls.[^3]

Decoupling stands are helpful for keeping the speakers from reverberating through the surface they sit on.[^4]
