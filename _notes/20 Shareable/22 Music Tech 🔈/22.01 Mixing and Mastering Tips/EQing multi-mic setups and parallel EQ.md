# EQing multi-mic setups and parallel EQ
Parallel bell filtering creates only a slightly wider Q value. Parallel shelves never reach 180 degree phase cancellation, and are simply shifted a bit higher.[^1]

Check phase this to make sure the EQ phase-shift hasn't put the group out of phase with one another.[^2] If they are out of phase, I can then address this with polarity switch, phase rotation, or switch to linear phase EQ (see [[How to adjust phase]]).

Beware parallel low-pass and [[High-pass filters]].[^1] You can, however, use a 6dB/oct slope without much harm, and a 12dB/oct shelf provides a dip before the rise.[^3]
