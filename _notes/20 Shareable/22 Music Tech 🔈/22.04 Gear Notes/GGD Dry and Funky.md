# GGD Dry and Funky
Inspired by The Fearless Flyers drum sound.[^1]

In the mixer window, Trash is a trashy room mic.[^1]

You can change the midi note mapping in the settings.[^1]

You can tune different drums by using multiple instances of the Kontakt library, using the mixer to isolate the drum you want to tune, then using Kontakt's native Tune knob.[^2] I think I'd prefer to do this in post with a plugin.

Use [[Multi-routing MIDI with Kontakt and Reaper]] to separate the drums into their own channels.
