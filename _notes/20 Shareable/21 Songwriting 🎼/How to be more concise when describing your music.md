# How to be more concise when describing your music
Make it 6 words or less. 

Put it in context of genres/styles/concepts that people are already familiar with, e.g. Cajun slamgrass. 

Use artists you sound like. Let their marketing work for you. 

Rule people out. Don't try to cater to everyone.[^1]
