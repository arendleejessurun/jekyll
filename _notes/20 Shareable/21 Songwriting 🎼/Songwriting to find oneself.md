# Songwriting to find oneself
When writing a song and allowing oneself to just be, there isn't anyone else's image to compete with. I can even take a break from my own image of myself.^[ [[How to Write One Song]], ch. 1]

Jeff Tweedy wanted to be Bob Dylan. What that really means to him is that he wanted to do what Bob Dylan does. Focus on what you want to do rather than who you want to be.^[ [[How to Write One Song]], ch. 1]

I want to find my voice, get to know myself a little better, as I learned from [[Mary Gauthier on The Working Songwriter]].
