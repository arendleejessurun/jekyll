# Write from a different perspective
Write from the point-of-view of another character, like an animal. Jeff Tweedy says he has written some very personal songs this way. The cover of being someone or something else may allow you to be honest. You can write as or for another artist too.^[ [[How to Write One Song]] ch. 14] Imagine the way that they look at the world, and write from there.^[ [[Steal Like an Artist]] pg. 36] [[Imitation is an exercise in finding one's voice]].
