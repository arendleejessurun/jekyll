# Remix musical ideas
Take a chord progression you love and write a new melody to it. In jazz, this is called a contrafact. Chord progressions are not protected by copyright, however, be careful not to steal the chord progression as well as other elements like groove, instrumentation, tempo, etc.[^1] Jeff Tweedy says if he can still recall the original song, he discards or alters more.[^2]

Use samples (but make sure to clear the licensing).

Write new lyrics to an existing melody.[^2] Or write a new melody for existing lyrics.

Keep a "morgue file" of things you'd like to remix later.[^3]

Lastly, if you're going to *totally* rip something, you've got to add something to it to try to make it better.[^4]
