# Avoid adjectives
"The dog barked loudly" is weaker than "The dog barked." Some people, like Bob Dylan, may be able to get away with adjectives, but Jeff Tweedy says he feels like he needs to earn them.[^1]

![[Every adjective and adverb is worth five cents]]

Err on the side of keeping it simple. Just like in the [[Mixing maxims]], don't use the complicated devices before you've tried the simple devices. 

![[Always prefer the plain direct word â€”C.S. Lewis]]

Pick more evocative and direct verbs and nouns instead of reaching for adjectives.[^2] If you can't get away from using an adjective, try making it into a [[Hendiadys]].

The [[Word ladder]] can be an effective exercise to refresh adjectives if you've exhausted all your options and have really got to use one.
