# Imitation is an exercise in finding one's voice
Make something in the style of an artist you admire.[^1] Don't worry about "originality."

![[Some writers confuse authenticity â€¦ with originality]]

Imitation is how we learn, and it is how we were encouraged to learn a children.[^2] By imitating, we inherit.[^3] We develop our own voices because we are influenced by other artists.[^4]

![[Those who do not want to imitate anything]]

Imitation helped Jeff Tweedy write a lot of songs that might not have otherwise made it through the "dense, neurotic thicket of self-doubt and insecurity that defined my own self-image."[^1]

![[At the end of the copy you will find yourself]]

![[Only copy things that really, truly move you]]

Conan O'Brien shares that many comedians have tried to emulate their heroes and haven't quite nailed it, but in so doing, they develop their own thing.[^5]
