# The nicest things people have said about my music
"I think you're brilliant." - Yohan Partan, on my songwriting 

"Your style is sparse. You play the notes that are supposed to be there. You don't overplay." - Matt Axton, on my guitar playing

"The world needs your live music now more than ever." - Chris, Human Barbie

"That was a beautiful song. I feel like I got a bum deal: I'm dating a musician that doesn't want to play their music," Jess said, with tears of joy in her eyes. "I don't really mean that," she laughed. "I just miss hearing your music."

"Dude, your lyricism gets me every time." - Scott Johnson, after hearing me play Before it Drifts Away
