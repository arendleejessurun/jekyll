# Niksen
In Dutch, this is "doing nothing," roughly translated as "nixing." Niksen is a little different from mindfulness because it is literally about doing nothing without any purpose.[^1] Sandi Mann says niksen can be "when we're not doing the things we should be doing. Because perhaps we don't want to, we're not motivated."[^2]

U.K. Mann, author of _The Upside of Downtime: Why Boredom Is Good_, marks a distinction between boredom activities and concentration activities like yoga or meditation.[^3] Doreen Dodger-Magee, a psychologist who studies boredom, says, "The way I think about boredom is coming to a moment with no plan other than just to be."[^2]

It's kinda like [[Sitting just to sit]]. [[Take boredom as an invitation to rest]]. Niksen can be an effective stress-reliever.[^1] There is a psychological, restful benefit to wasting time. It can even improve productivity.[^4] [[Get bored to get creative]].
