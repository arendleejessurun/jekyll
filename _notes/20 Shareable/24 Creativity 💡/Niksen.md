# Niksen
![[Don't just do something; stand there]]

In Dutch, this is "doing nothing," roughly translated as "nixing."

Niksen is a little different from mindfulness because it is literally about doing nothing without any purpose.[^1] Sandi Mann says niksen can be "when we're not doing the things we should be doing. Because perhaps we don't want to, we're not motivated."[^2] In this way, niksen is the body's natural response to [[Break in case of burnout|Burnout]].

![[Avoiding work is the way to focus my mind]]

U.K. Mann, author of _The Upside of Downtime: Why Boredom Is Good_, marks a distinction between boredom activities and concentration activities like yoga or meditation.[^3]

Doreen Dodger-Magee, a psychologist who studies boredom, says, "The way I think about boredom is coming to a moment with no plan other than just to be."[^2]

It's kinda like [[Sitting just to sit]]. [[Take boredom as an invitation to rest]].

Reorganize your environment, keeping electronic distractions away from certain places. Invite people over for a boredom party.[^2]

Niksen can be an effective stress-reliever.[^1] There is a psychological, restful benefit to wasting time. It can improve productivity.[^4] [[Get bored to get creative]].
