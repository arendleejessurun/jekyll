# Lynda Barry journal method

She explains in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hiY7mU_07Y&list=PLFllVdBEQA4qe2iwHw3BmP6Y_x-Nl4MQt&index=2). She says, "If you do it everyday, you'll start to notice what it is you notice."

Ben Snakepit makes a three-panel comic each day based on what he did that day.[^1] Maybe instead of the drawing aspect of Lynda Barry's method, I can write a little song or poem each day. Maybe I can make a collage of pictures from that day.

It's quick and easy to do, which makes it easier to build into a habit. (The thing I didn't like about Julia Cameron's [[Morning pages]] is how tedious it was.)

It fits all writing styles and mediums. I like how it can suit me as a songwriter.

It generates authentic ideas because it draws from things that actually happened to you. This is an exercise in [[How to find your voice and why]] and even write in writer's block.[^2]

Somewhere Anna Tivel has talked about how John Prine taught her how to see. I want to learn more about her and John Prine's philosophy.
