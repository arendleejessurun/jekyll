# The Reading Process—A Phenomenological Approach
[PDF](https://ctlsites.uga.edu/eberle/wp-content/uploads/sites/78/2017/08/iser_readingProcess.pdf)

Written by Wolfgang Iser.

A literary work is made up of the artistic and the aesthetic: the author's work and the reader's work in making meaning.

![[Leave them something to imagine - Laurence Stern]]

If the author gives away too much, the reader will become bored; too little, and the reader becomes burdened.

"Intentional sentence correlatives" is was Roman Ingarden and Iser call the way sentences react with each other, which results in a "world presented." This world is an emergent phenomenon of these correlatives—the sum is greater than its parts.

The literary work needs the reader's imagination, which makes sense of the sentence correlatives. The author intentionally orders sentences to guide the reader, to create an expectation, or what Husserl calls a "pre-intention."

When a literary text fulfills the expectation it sets up, what Iser calls a "confirmation effect," we may think it too expository or didactic, at which point we are forced to either accept or reject its thesis (and often we choose to reject it). [[Art is resistance]]. In a good literary text, the sentence correlatives are continually changing by their interactions, via anticipation and retrospection. This is why a reader feels involved in the events of a literary story.

Reading incites our own creative faculties, the product of which is the "virtual dimension" of a text: the coming together of text and imagination.

When the flow of a text is interrupted, the opportunity is given to the reader to make the connection, filling in the gaps left by the text. This contrasts Ingarden's classical idea that the flow should not be interrupted.
