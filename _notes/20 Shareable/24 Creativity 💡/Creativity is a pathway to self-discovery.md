# Creativity is a pathway to self-discovery
Mary Gauthier says the goal of writing is to find your voice.[^1] We figure out who we are by making things. Austin Klein says, "Don't wait until you know who you are to get started."[^2]

Start by owning your story. Figure out what's in your "creative family tree." The more branches, the more unique.[^3]

Mark Stryker says that as you practice—that is, develop your artistry—you won't only find the music, but you may find yourself too.[^4]

Creating something may start to reveal a truth that you haven't fully grasped yet. Mary Gauthier says [[Songs are seers]].

When developing your voice, beware of what you think your voice *should* be. [[Read as little as possible of aesthetic criticism]]. Remember [[Judgment is a creativity thief]].

Creating is about not trying to do anything or be anything anymore.[^5] [[Creative flow leads to ego death]]. James Baldwin says writing involves "finding out what you don't want to know, what you don't want to find out."[^6] Jeff Tweedy says if you feel a little uncomfortable about what you wrote, you know you're on the right track.[^7]

![[The Artist is no other than he who unlearns —E.E. Cummings]]

Creative practice is just another facet of being human. Ferron says, when asked about her song "Testimony", "What is the formula for writing a song like that? I don't know, almost die? ... If you put all that together and sit down somewhere and weep, you might write 'Testimony.' It's not a craft. Survival was the craft."[^8]

![[We usually define ourselves by what we do —Herbie Hancock]]

One way to come back to being a human is to [[Practice little sabbaticals]].

Not only does the artist discover themselves, but the audience too.

![[Art enables us to find ourselves]]
