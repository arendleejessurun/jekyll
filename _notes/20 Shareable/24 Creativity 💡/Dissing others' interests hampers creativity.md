# Dissing others' interests harms their creativity
If following your interests fosters creativity, then don't diss your or others' interests. There's a part of me that feels this way about video games, and I think that's because my dad would discourage us playing them. But video games were a big source of inspiration for me as a kid. Perhaps they still are. Video game music played a huge part in me wanting to become a musician. It has informed my taste as a composer.

Not only can it hamper their creativity, but it can hamper your own by closing yourself off to a potential avenue of inspiration. [[Judgment is a creativity thief]].
