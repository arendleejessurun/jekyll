# Practice little sabbaticals
Total resets matter,[^1] but daily rest and recovery is vital.[^2] I'm in the habit of doing a self-date day once a week, but I want to develop other rhythms. What if I do self-date stuff everyday? What if I take an extended weekend once a month?

Notice the times when you're most productive and when your mind starts to shut off. In those times when you go on autopilot, that's when to schedule a little sabbatical.[^3]

Taking little sabbaticals, even for just 30 minutes, is important for creativity and productivity.[^4] [[Living your life gives you something to write about]].
