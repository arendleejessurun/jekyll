# Art is resistance

Wolfgang Iser says that good literature is not didactic[^1] It doesn't tell us what to think, but it invites us to think with it.

Preserving folk art traditions is resistance.[^2] To me, Americana is music of the working class. In the mid-century, there were elements of class consciousness explored through folk music. What if I find and cover those songs?

When people are creating, they're not burning a ton of fossil fuels (usually). They're not merely consuming stuff. They're not binge drinking (or at least, they don't need to be, cough, Hemingway).

William Blake believed imagination would do better to liberate people than either canvassing or protesting.[^3] I wouldn't say that much, but it sure is encouraging to hear this point of view, as an artist who often feels like their work is not improving society.
