# How to recover from writer's block
Reframe it as a writer's hurdle, not a block. You've just got to get enough momentum to scale it. I think I heard this on Creative Pep Talk.

[[Use your better judgment]]. [[Make what you like]].

Accept that [[Fear is a part of the creative process]].

[[Have a conversation with your resistant self]].

[[Don't try to create and analyze at the same time]]. [[Edit your art later]]. Just put stuff down and [[Be willing to write a bad song]].
