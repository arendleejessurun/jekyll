# Read as little as possible of aesthetic criticism
This advice comes from Rilke. Aesthetic critiques are either partisan and indurate, or passing, teeter-tottering fads. Only love can grasp works of art.[^1] [[We know things by giving ourselves to them]].

I think this is why I was particularly frustrated by some of Mary Oliver's writing about contemporary poetry in [[A Poetry Handbook]].

W. H. Auden says something similar.

[[Judgment is a creativity thief]]
