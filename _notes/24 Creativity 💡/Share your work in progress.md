# Share your work in progress
[[Make it easy to share stuff]]. Even if nothing is finished yet, share snippets.[^1] The old way was to hide one's process. The new way is to show as you go. This can be WIPs, studio pics, inspirations, influences, etc.[^2] "Become a documentarian of what you do," says Austin Kleon. Take pictures, write, record videos to share about your process.[^3]

![[They want to see what you have made]]

Ze Frank says he's more interested in what job candidates are working on right now, as opposed to their portfolio.[^4]

It may scare the ego to pull back the curtain, but [[Creative flow leads to ego death]]. In this way, sharing is not so much about what your ego gets out of it, but rather [[Sharing is an act of generosity]].

Not only can sharing get your work in front of others, but [[Sharing can inform your work]].
