# How to write a story
Storyboard artist Emma Coats outlines a fairytale form as the following: "Once upon a time, there was (blank). Every day, (blank). One day, (blank). Because of that, (blank). Because of that, (blank). Until finally, (blank)."[^1]

Author John Gardner says, "A character wants something, goes after it despite opposition ... and so arrives at a win, lose, or draw."[^2]

If you're in the middle of a story, you can tell it as a pitch or a choose-your-own adventure: share where you've been, where you find yourself now, and where you may be in the future.[^3]
