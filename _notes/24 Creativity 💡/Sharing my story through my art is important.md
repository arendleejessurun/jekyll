# Sharing my story through my art is important
[[Speaking my truth]]

![[How could you live and have no story to tell?]]

Maia Kobabe encourages anyone thinking about it to tell their story through their art. The very people who hesitate to share are the people we need to hear from. It will also bring friendship, joy, community, and career possibilities.[^1] Ayumi Horie says one's artistic voice is correlated to sharing one's truth, which is an act of resistance for marginalized individuals.[^2]

![[If you break faith with what you know]]

[[What things are part of my story?]]

Andy J. Miller says [[Every piece is like a self-portrait]], even if it's not autobiographical. 

Mary Gauthier says telling her story allows her to cope or sometimes write a happier ending. In doing so, she goes from being the story to becoming the storyteller. Joe Pug adds, sometimes it's not writing a happier story but [[Integration|integrating]] parts of himself into his persona.[^3]

Brandi Carlile says she feels like she's always coming out, feeling on the edge of being rejected, so she wrote her memoir to get it all out there. Her hardships are what have given her a story. In Brandi's memoir she tells her truth and doesn't mythologize herself or tie a bow on her past (which is [[Spiritual bypassing]]).[^4]

There is universality in the particular. [[Generalism is an enemy of wonder]]. [[Art is conversation]]. Don't fall for the idea that writing about your story is navel-gazing. Your story is likely connected to a larger issue. Research or Outreach can be helpful for developing what you have to say about this larger issue. Uddipana Goswami says writing short memoirs and personal essays helped her heal. She shared these stories with others and began to find solidarity.[^5] Other people relate to stories of the human experience.[^6]

![[I'm not so much a writer as I'm a citizen]]

Before sharing my story, it's important to ask, [[Is this story only mine to share?]]
