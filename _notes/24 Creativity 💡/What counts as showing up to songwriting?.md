# What counts as showing up to songwriting?
Even looking at a blank page for your scheduled creative time counts.

Do a [[Songwriting exercises|Songwriting exercise]] or a [[Journal prompts|Journal prompt]].

Organize, review, or otherwise work on my song sketches.

Review my journal to look for inspiration.

Practice one of my instruments.

Play around on an instrument.

Audition sounds: instruments, synths, samples, loops.

Record scratch tracks.
