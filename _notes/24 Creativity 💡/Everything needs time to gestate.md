# Everything needs time to gestate
![[Everything that is allowed to be still will be much better]]

For the artist, there is no measuring with time.[^1] Let your ideas and your art gestate.

![[Being an artist means not reckoning and counting]]

Not every idea is ready to be developed. Save it for later. I have a list of [[Ideas and questions]] and an [[Inbox ðŸ“¥]] of notes. Create a pipeline for those ideas so they can eventually be developed and not forgotten.[^2]
