# Welcome! ðŸŒ±
Hey this Arend, and this my digital garden. A digital garden is a place for my notes to grow as I continue to learn about music and audio, and it's also a place where visitors can wander about and read them. 

These notes are organized via the [Johnny Decimal system](https://johnnydecimal.com), with the 20s being my shareable notes. I write and organize these notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and publish them with [Jekyll](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll). If you find some broken links here or there, it's likely because the broken link goes to a personal note.
